## :pencil: Presenter Bio

> J. Rosenbaum is a contemporary figurative artist working in 3D modeling and exploring the boundaries of technology and art. Their most recent work has been in exploring the nature of Non Binary Transness and their own genders and sexuality. Well known for being a painter of nudes, Rosenbaum has recently completed a masters degree and changed focus to more technologically based digital art using physics based rendering, Deep Neural Networks and Unity to develop an Augmented Reality mobile application.
Following a car accident that impaired Rosenbaum’s mobility they have turned their mind inwards exploring the nature of humanity, religion and gender through art. The human body has always been a source of fascination in Rosenbaum’s art with a focus on mythical and archaeological stories driving their progress. This fascination has continued with their newest Computer Generated works with a basis in classical art and history.
J is an American working from their home in Victoria, Australia with their partner and child and two cats.

## :collision: Show stoppers

I know it is hard to organise events, so I want to make sure that we are on the same level. Here is a list of things that I will not do. 

* :x: I will not present at a panel or a conference line-up with an obvious lack of diversity. Our audience comes in all shapes and sizes, so should the experts on stage
* :x: I expect the conference to have an enforced code of conduct 
* :x: I don't "pay to play". As a presenter, I expect full access to the event.
* :x: I have a disability and require a minimum of stairs with a handrail. 
* :x: I do not have a company supporting my travel. I'm a "starving artist" and therefore require travel assistance to get to conferences out of town. 

## :dancer: My deliveries at your event

Here's what I will do when invited as a presenter at your event.

- [x] **Deliver a fitting talk for the intended audience.** My talk will be an up-to-date reflecting the latest technologies and my practice with them. I practice talk driven development and research my subject avidly.
- [x] **Deliver a talk with passion and excitement.** I love my subjects. I really really adore talking about them and showing the exciting things people are making. 
- [x] **Deliver the talk on time and sticking to the defined format and duration.** I need to know what time frame you expect and what format you want it to be in. I will show up at the times you need me to be there and set up on stage with enough time for AV people to wire up microphones and other equipment. 
- [x] **Be available for conference attendees.** Conferences to me are more about the people than about the content. Therefore I will try to be there for questions and feedback.
- [x] **Be available for other promotional parts of the event.** I am happy to do interviews or give you feedback to use in conference wrap-ups
- [x] **Promote my presence at your event.** I will tweet and blog before, during and after the event about what I will do at your event and interesting things I encounter. 
- [x] **Publish my slides and screen recording after my talk.** If there is a good enough connection, this normally happens right after the presentation. Everything I create at your event will be licensed Creative Commons unless otherwise agreed. 

## :computer: My setup 

I am pretty open to different ways of presenting, but here is my perfect setup

- [x] I use an iPad Pro to present. I provide an HDMI to lightning dongle with my kit.
- [x] I do not have a laptop but if you prefer to loan me one I bring a backup of my talk on USB and have it on Dropbox
- [x] I am happy send slides in advance when there is live translation or signing. Then I will also have a list of terms to translate and can put some time aside with the translators to go through the deck.

If I need to use a central computer instead of mine, please consider the following:

- [x] My slides are in Keynote and Powerpoint. I will have them on a memory stick with the needed fonts.
- [x] I don't use any audio or video in my slides, but some GIF animations.
- [x] I need to be able to see my notes when I am speaking to be able to deliver the best talk I can.

## :pray: My expectations

I am a professional presenter, and will do a lot to ensure that the event will be a success. As such, I have a few expections I want met:

- [ ] **Provide me with a prime speaking slot.** I've proven to be a good keynote speaker and find interesting and fun topics to open or close conferences. 
- [ ] **Deliver a professional stage setup.** I bring my own iPad and connectors, but I expect at least a power plug and a microphone. I normally don't need an internet connection, but would love to have one. 
- [ ] **Record and publish my talk.** Recordings are a great advertisement for your conference and I make sure my presentations make sense without being in the room.  

## :money_with_wings: Cost and payments/expenses

Presenting is one of the ways I earn a living from my art. I welcome any contribution you can make towards my career as a presenter and as an artist. If I am traveling overseas or interstate I require travel assistance for myself and preferably my carer as well. If I am traveling internationally I prefer to have at least a day before the conference to settle in and recover spoons.  

There are always options to haggle about these things. I'm a reasonable person and if you spend your time creating a great event where money isn't your main goal, we'll find a way. 

## :boom: Things can go wrong... 

Even with the best intentions, there may be trouble and I might not be available for your event. You may also change your mind. If that happens, here's what I want to happen.

- [x] When I can not attend for some reason or another, I will make very much sure to find a replacement presenter to fill in for me. I have a great network of peers and professional speakers that I can call on. I have not once had to miss a conference but I want to assure you that I will do everything in my power to not leave you in the lurch.
- [x] When for some reason you decide to slash my speaking slot, I expect you to cover the cost involved for me. Often I can book my own flights as I book other appointments around events. Many of them aren't refundable.
